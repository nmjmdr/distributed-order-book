# distributed-order-book
distributed order book

TO DO:

This code does not include peer-to-peer communication using grenache
It includes order matching and all nodes run inside a single process (next step will be to include grenache and distribute the nodes)


Here is a sample of order matching:

node-1: places buy orders

node-2: places sell orders

Orders get matched
